Better-Power-Armor-Grid=原版扩展：个人装备
[mod-description]
Better-Power-Armor-Grid=[color=green]Extended Vanilla: Personal Equipment[/color]\n对原版个人装备进行了大改，该模组增加了多个级别的装甲、机器人指令模块、外骨骼模块、激光防御模块、能量盾模块、聚变反应堆模块，以及两种新的装备——组装模块、背包模块，二者可以加速手工制造物品的速度，以及提升背包容量。\n模组完全可自定义，和K2以及Earendel（太空探索和AAI工业作者）的喷气背包兼容。\n（更详细的内容请参阅模组主页的说明）。

[mod-setting-description]
ev-equipment-recipe-difficulty=If enabled, equipment technologies and craftings are more difficult, more prerequisites are required to unlock specific pieces of equipment and they need more resources to craft.

armors-enabled=If true, the advanced tiers of power armors can be researched and crafted.
equipment-division=This setting enables the division between "aggro" (combat) and "engineering" (industrial) equipment. \nIf active, you won't be capable of putting specific types of equipment in the vanilla power armors (roboports, exoskeletons, etc.). Indeed, they'll be compatible only with industrial ones. (The same thing applies to "aggro" armors with the highest tiers of lasers and shields). \nCurrently only EV mods support this feature.
grid-size=Changes the size of each armor's grid. \nThe changes involve each tier: small (-2 grid size), medium (default), laaarge (+2), too ez (+4). \nI mean I see you want something broken at all costs...
maximum-armor-tier=With this setting you can decide to make some tiers of armor unresearchable if you think they're too op.

fusion-reactors-enabled=If true, the advanced tiers of fusion reactors can be researched and crafted.
fusion-reactor-equipment-height=Allows you to set the grid height of all fusion reactors.
fusion-reactor-equipment-width=Allows to set the grid width of all fusion reactors.
fusion-reactor-power-multiplier=Multiplies the base power generation of each tier of fusion reactors by this amount. \nThe base values per tier are the following: 1.0MW (mk2), 2.0MW (mk3), 3.0MW (mk4), 4.0MW (mk5), 6.0MW (mk6)

exoskeletons-enabled=If true, the advanced tiers of exoskeletons can be researched and crafted.
exoskeleton-equipment-height=Allows you to set the grid height of all exoskeletons.
exoskeleton-equipment-width=Allows you to set the grid width of all exoskeletons.
exoskeleton-movement-bonus-multiplier=Multiplies the base movement bonus given by each tier of exoskeletons by this amount. \nThe base values per tier are the following: 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0.

roboports-enabled=If true, the advanced tiers of roboports can be researched and crafted.
roboports-robot-limit=Modifies the amounts of robots that each tier of roboports can handle.
roboports-construction-radious=Modifies the construction radious of each tier of roboports.

shields-enabled=If true, the advanced tiers of shields can be researched and crafted.
